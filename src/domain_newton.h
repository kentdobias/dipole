 * state          - GSL_VECTOR
 *                On entry, state gives the system's initial condition.  On
 *                exit, state contains the result Newton's method.
 *
 * size           - UNSIGNED INTEGER
 *                On entry, size gives the size of the vector state.  Unchanged
 *                on exit.
 *
 * params         - UNSIGNED INTEGER
 *                On entry, params gives the number of non-multiplier elements
 *                in state, which are assumed by the function to be the first
 *                elements of state.  Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * get_energy     - ENERGY_FUNC
 *                On entry, get_energy is a function that returns a double
 *                float.  The first argument of get_energy is an unsigned
 *                integer and the second argument is a gsl_vector object.  This
 *                function is expected to take size and state, respectively,
 *                and return the energy of that state.  Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * get_grad       - GRAD_FUNC

 *                argument of get_grad is an unsigned integer, and the third
 *                argument of get_grad is a gsl_vector object.  This function
 *                is expected to take a vector of size size, size, and state,
 *                respectively.  It leaves the gradient of the energy function
 *                in the first argument.  Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * get_hess       - HESS_FUNC
 *                On entry, get_hess is a function that returns void.  The
 *                first argument of get_hess is a gsl_matrix object, the second
 *                argument of get_hess is an unsigned integer, and the third
 *                argument of get_hess is a gsl_vector object.  This function
 *                is expected to take a matrix of size size by size, size, and
 *                state, respectively.  It leaves the Hessian of the energy
 *                function in the first argument.  Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * epsilon        - DOUBLE FLOAT
 *                On entry, epsilon gives the number that is used to judge
 *                convergence.  When the norm of the gradient is less than
 *                epsilon * size, the process is deemed complete and the
 *                iterations are stopped.  Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * max_iterations - UNSIGNED INTEGER
 *                On entry, max_iterations gives the maximum number of times
 *                the algorithm will repeat before failing.  Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * beta           - DOUBLE FLOAT
 *                On entry, beta gives the number which is exponentiated to
 *                scale the step size in Newton's method.  Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * s              - DOUBLE FLOAT
 *                On entry, s gives a constant scaling of the step size in
 *                Newton's method.  Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * sigma          - DOUBLE FLOAT
 *                On entry, sigma gives a scaling to the condition on the step
 *                size in Newton's method.  Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * gamma          - DOUBLE FLOAT
 *                On entry, gamma gives the amount by which the norm of the
 *                gradient must change for eta to decrement by a factor delta.
 *                Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * eta_0          - DOUBLE FLOAT
 *                On entry, eta_0 gives the starting value of eta.  Unchanged
 *                on exit.
 *
 * delta          - DOUBLE FLOAT
 *                On entry, delta gives the factor by which eta is decremented.
 *                Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * bound          - DOUBLE FLOAT
 *                On entry, delta gives an upper bound to the gradient norm.
 *                If surpassed, the execution is halted and the program returns
 *                failure.  Unchanged on exit.
 *
 * verbose        - BOOLEAN
 *                On entry, verbose indicates whether verbose output will be
 *                printed to stdout by this program.  Unchanged on exit.
